Chapter One: Getting Started
What is an Operating System?
A computer, complete with all its parts – the CPU, mouse, monitor,
and keyboard – will not work without a central program that will piece it all
together. An operating system, or OS, for short is the software that brings
together a computer’s hardware and the different programs that you want to
install on it. When you boot up a PC without an OS, you will be directed to
the command prompt that makes no sense to most computer users. You will
be unable to watch videos, listen to music, edit photos, or to simply write a
note.
An operating system is responsible for doing the following tasks:
Detect hardware – An OS is responsible for validating the
components of a computer during boot up (hard drive, CPU,
network cards, mouse, etc.) and loading the corresponding
drivers and modules for the hardware to properly run.
Manage processes – Similar to the way our mind works,
several processes or applications are running on a computer
at the same time. It is the OS that is responsible for allocating
CPU resources. The OS also provides the user the option to
start, stop, or restart a process.
Manage memory – Each application needs a specific
amount of RAM and swap memory to function. The OS is
responsible for assigning memory allocations and for
handling memory requests.
Initiate user interfaces - An OS offers users ways to access
the system either via a command line or a graphical user
interface (GUI)
