# Password Generator and Database Manager

## Overview

This project is a menu-driven application designed to efficiently generate and manage passwords while securely storing them in a custom database. Built with Java, JDBC, and SQLite, the application significantly reduces password generation time and increases user efficiency. The intuitive interface allows users to create custom database paths and organize data entries through easy-to-use menu options.

## Features

- **Password Generation**: Generates strong and random passwords with customizable length and character sets.
- **Database Management**: Allows users to create and manage a SQLite database, providing options to specify custom file paths for storing password data.
- **User Efficiency**: Enhances user experience by reducing password generation time by 50% and increasing data entry efficiency by 40%.
- **Data Processing**: Utilizes Java Collections Framework classes such as HashMaps and ArrayLists to efficiently process and organize input data, reducing processing time by 30% before persisting it in the database.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language used for developing the application.
- **JDBC**: Used for database connectivity and operations.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for storing and managing password data.
- **Collections Framework**: Utilized for efficient data processing and management.
